A List of common programming languages for html as dropdown and checkboxes.

## Intro

I was working on [Techpro.club](https://github.com/ClubTechPro/techpro.club) where I needed list of programming languages as HTML forms (checkboxes and dropdown). But I could not find any already existing repository for the same. I realized that many projects would need to show a list of programming languages as checkboxes in their applications as well. Hence the idea.

Feel free to add more programming languages or types.
